                <h4>The Brief</h4>
                <h2>Transforming the Seattle Commute</h2>
                <p>Orca wants to reduce the amount of cars on the roads and become more environmentally friendly by providing better experience for people using public transit for their daily commute. Currently, the Orca Card site is the only online access point away from the kiosks and retail locations, which is not mobile friendly. The site also does not have the structure to support easy access to information or card management.</p>
                <h3>Aspects to Consider</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>What are some of the unmet needs & pain points of current Orca Card users?</li>
                    <li>What unmet needs do users have which might be met by a mobile application?</li>
                    <li>What are the most important & relevant informations for daily commuters?</li>

                <img class="responsive" id="two-weeks" src="images/two_weeks.svg" alt="">
                <p>This project was <b>two week long sprint</b>. Within this short period we have done intensive <b>user research</b> to uncover the most comon needs/pain points of current Orca card users.The reesults of our user interviews clearly validated out <b>initial hypothesis</b>.<br>To avoid any communication problems and to insure that we can work in a pleasent and productiv environmet we spend and entire day on building proper <b>team charter</b>, clear timeline and working environment/stylesheet. I have been appointed to be a <b>team leader</b> responsible for <b>conflict resolution</b> and any problem that would arise.</p>

                <h4>Discovery Stage</h4>
                <h2>Year 2020</h2>
                <p>The first thing on our list was to understand the limitation of the current system. Through our <b>market research</b> we found out everything about the current technology and the contract between King County and Vix Technology (ORCA). We also find out about new contract that is already in place and will be implemented in 2019.
                Based on the data promising bright future and after breaf <b>consultation with developers</b> we have decided to focus on the vision we had for our application rather than limiting our design to fit current limitation like lack of protocol for <b>Apple Pay</b>.</p>

                <h4>User Interviews</h4>
                <h2>What Linda Told Us</h2>
                <img class="responsive" id="quote" src="images/quote.svg" alt=""><p>Our <b>primary persona</b> Linda Bee is a result of 15 <b>user interviews</b> that we have conducted in first two days of our project. Linda told us a lot of important informations like quote: <strong><em>"I never know how much money I've left on my Orca card"</em></strong>. But what really surprised us was how unsafe she feels. She says:<strong><em>"I allways carry a pepper spray with me."</em></strong>We have revieled that 9 out of 10 women is affraid of being followed by a stranger; 7 out of 10 carries pepper spray; and 3 out of 10 were previously sexually assaulted. This imposed <b>unexpected challeng</b>. We knew we had only 10 days left before our <b>pitch</b> and this was not something we wanted to leave out!</p>

                <h4>The Journey</h4>
                <h2>Empathy is the shortest way to understanding</h2>
                <p>Our vison was clear, but we knew we needed to create good <b>story board</b> so everyone can understand our <b>user journey</b> right from the begining of our <b>pitch</b>.</p>

                <p><img class="responsive" id="img-google" src="images/google.png" alt="">Only a charlatan would speak about a future without looking into a present moment. We prefer to use <b>market research</b> as an indicator of the future. Our <b>user interviews</b> showed us that commuters in Seattle prefer to use two application <b>Google Maps</b> and <b>One Bus Away</b>. After a <b>close examination</b>of both apps we have decided to find a way how to <b>intagrate</b>rather than compete against them. After all our primary goal was to create <b>great user experience</b> and breaking <b>user's habits</b> is certainly not the way.</p>

                <h4>The Approach</h4>
                <h2>Agile, Agile, Agile..</h2>
                <p>After we ran our initial <b>design studio</b> and unloaded all of our ideas into basic <b>sketches</b> we selected the concepts that were best addressing the four <b>major needs</b> we have identified in the <b>user interviews</b>. We knew we wanted to address all four of them but we were also aware of our time limitation.</p>
                <h2 id="first-tension">First tension</h2>
                <p>This was a moment of a <b>first tension</b> in our team. Everyone wanted for the project to succeed but evryone seemed to have <b>different opinion</b> on how shoud we prioritize our time. As a elected leader it was <b>my responsibility</b> to come up with a quick resolution. I called for a short break. While my collegues were getting fresh cup of coffee I have decided to build a quick <b>paper prototype</b>. When they've returned together we went through quick round of <b>usability testing</b>. This gave us even deeper understanding of our users and we were able to disect our application into a four parts – <b>4 MVPs</b>. </p>

                <h4>Main Goal</h4>
                <p>Our main goal for our presentation was to have working <b>clickable prototype</b> build in <b>Axure</b>. To acheave this goal we had to work in very <b>agile</b> way. I was <b>responsible</b> for building the <b>prototype</b> and my technical knoledge of <b>Axure</b> came in very handy. While I worked on the <b>wireframes</b> and <b>micro interactions</b> Katherine worked in <b>Sketch</b> to create all the final assets. Johny's biggest strenght lies in his people skill and therefore he was responsible for the <b>usability testing</b> and preparing our presentation.</p>

                <h4>Moving Quickly</h4>
                <p>We would start our mornings by <b>sketching</b> and <b>iterating</b> on a new findings from <b>usability testing</b> we did day before. As soon as I had the next part of the prototype ready we would conduct quick <b>usability test</b>. Katherine was preparing the assets we knew would not change. We would close our day by quick discussion and planing for next day.</p>

                <h4>The Framework</h4>
                <h2>Think Wrong</h2>
                <p>The biggest challenge I faced in this project was letting of <b>perfectionism</b> and <i>moving forward with the design</i>. Our <b>goal</b> was the <i>vison</i> not the <i>final design</i>. Managing <b>feedback</b> both given and received was stressfull and at times painful because everyone strived for <i>perfection</i>. I had to constantly remined my-self to concentrate on the vision and concept and not to dive to deep into details. </p>

            </div>
            <div class="row" id="row_18">
                <p>There are two big take aways from this project. First one is– <i>Allow your-self to think wrong</i>. Second one is– <i>Speak up if given feedback is not constructive</i>.<br>Letting go of perfectionism, allowing my-self to make mistakes leads to creative freedom that results in more <b>inovative</b> and <b>out-of-box solutions</b>. Don't give in, speak up and maintaine <b>healthy boundaries</b>. <b>Non-violant comunication</b> and ability to construct <b>well formulated feedback</b> are essential skills for anyone who wants to contribute to the team.</p>
